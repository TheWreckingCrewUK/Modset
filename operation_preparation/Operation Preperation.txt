1. Configure the description.ext
	1.1 Copy the description.ext from "common_operation" to the mission folder.
	1.2 In the description.ext replace "#Name#" with the operation name, e.g: "SANDCASTLE".
	1.3 In the description.ext replace "#Author Name#" with the name of the mission maker, e.g "TooTall".

2. Place down a base marker named "base", or rename an existing one. 
	(If using a British flag marker, use the one titled "UK", classname "flag_uk", because the one titled "Flag (Great Britain), classname "Faction_CUP_GB" has a bad ratio.

3. Set up the Operations Units.
	3.1 Place the correct era and type. Make sure to use COIN units if the briefing specifies it as COIN, and use the dismounted variants if the forcetype is airmobile, air assault, amphibious, dismounted, or airborne.
	3.2 Place platoon command, then 1 section, then 2 section, then 3 section, then the attachment. Order of placement determines order of the rolesheet.
	3.3 Name the group by double clicking the group icon and setting the callsign entry. They should be named "Platoon Command", "1 Section", "2 Section", "3 Section", and the name of the attachment on the rolesheet, respectively.
	3.4 Name the group leader by double clicking on him and setting the role description entry to be "Platoon Commander@Platoon Command", "Section Commander@1 Section" etc.
	3.5 Place down vehicles if applicable. Make sure they're the correct era and COIN variant if applicable. Ammoboxes should be placed alongside the vehicles for easy loading by the sergeant. For every vehicle placed, there should be a back-up vehicle in case the first gets destroyed.
	3.6 Place down Section Resupply Boxes. Make sure they are the correct era and COIN variant if applicable. Two boxes section boxes per section, as well as the correct launcher crate. Two medical boxes for the platoon, as well.
	3.7 Place down a Medical Tent at base and set as Medical Facility under Attributes >> "ACE Options".

4. Set up the repair facilities (Only applicable in case we start with vehicles):
	4.1 Place down an appropriate repair vehicle and / or facility and set them as such in Attributes >> "ACE Options".
	4.2 Make appropriate units Engineers (Vehicle Crew, 2ICs) and Repair Specialist (Sergeant, CSM).
	
6. Place down the 7 "Game Master" modules with the attribute "Default addons" set to "All addons (including unofficial ones)".
	They all need to be assigned a playerID at the "Owner" attribute.
	6.1 One with owner #adminLogged.
	6.2 One with owner 76561198070630639 (jayman).	
	6.3 One with owner 76561198109984047 (Ross).
	6.4 One with owner 76561198038415964 (BjÃ¶rn).
	6.5 One with owner 76561198051847668 (Harry).
	6.6 One with owner 76561198072105856 (lockoncap).
	6.7 One with owner 76561198050180681 (Saxon).
	6.8 One with owner 76561198037881029 (Rik).
	6.9 One with owner 76561198051444336 (Lukey).
	
	If anyone of these is playing a command role higher than 2iC, do NOT give them a module. 
	Recommended is saving this array of modules in a composition in game so that you only have to place down the composition and delete the ones not needed.

7. Set up the Headless Client:
	7.1 Place down the "TWC Headless Client Module" and set it to enabled, 120 seconds delay, and end mission disabled.
	7.2 Place down 1 "Headless Client" from Logic Entities (under systems in the top right) with the variable name being HC1 and set it as playable.

8. Set up the "Cache Configuration" Module and set it as enabled.
	8.1 The AI range attribute should take into account the sightlines of the map (open desert will require a higher range than dense jungle), so that AI units that we are unlikely to see should remain cached. Should not exceed 2000.
	8.2 The Vehicle Caching attribute should be ~500 higher than AI range, and also not exceed 2500.
	8.3 The Urban Caching should be limited to the maximum range of our sightlines on units that are synced with the "Set Urban Unit(s)" Module.
	8.4 Go through the mission and look for units that are deployed in places where they can only be spotted and engaged from a close distance. Make sure these are synced to a "Set Urban Unit(s)" Module.
	8.5 Go through the mission and look for units on patrols that are meant to cover a lot of ground, and possibly airplanes and helicopters that fly in from a distance, and sync these to a "Disable Caching on Units" module.

9. Place down the "TWC Missions Module" and set up as desired.
	9.1 Make sure the "Era" attribute is set to the correct one.
	9.2 The "Nighttime equipment" attribute should only be enabled if we are going to be doing a large amount of fighting in the night, not if it is just an early morning start.
	9.3 The "Shooting in base" attribute should be set to 0 if we are going to get attacked in base.
	
10. Various things you need to look out for:
	10.1 If we are to be fighting units on the independent side make sure that under "Attributes" >> "Misc" >> "Independents Allegiance" is set to be hostile to BLUFOR.
	10.2 Make sure the scenario file is set to be unbinarized under "Attributes" >> "Misc".
	10.3 The "Hide Terrain Objects" module needs to have the "Operate Locally" check mark ticked to work in multiplayer.
	10.4 The "Edit Terrain Object" module is broken and will not work correctly in multiplayer and cannot be used.
	10.5 On all triggers, make sure that if they execute code in their "On Activation" or "On Deactivation" fields that runs globally (check BIWiki for its effects) that the trigger atribute "Server Only" is ticked.
	10.6 "The BIS_fnc_ambientAnim" function will destroy FPS in multiplayer if used in large amounts and should be avoided.
	10.7 Particle effects like "Fire" and "Smoke" can be detrimental to FPS if used in large amounts or configured improperly.
